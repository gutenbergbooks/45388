    <h2>
      HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.
    </h2>
     <p class="pfirst">
<span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>OOTS is our baby. He is a queer one too; up early, and always in dread of
      bed-time. One morning, not long ago, we heard him singing, and on looking
      for him, found the little rogue in the very middle of our best bed in the
      guest chamber, where he was playing hand-organ with a long hairpin put
      through the pretty pillow covers which had just come home from the
      laundry. There he sat singing a droll medley of "Uncle Ned," "Blessed
      Desus," and "Down in the Coal Mine." He had been watching two soldiers
      with a hand-organ, and Toots likes to do everything he sees done. While we
      were putting the guest-room in order, Toots marched out as a blind man,
      with his eyes shut and a cane in his hand. This brought him to grief, for
      he was picked up at the foot of the stairs with two large bumps on his
      pretty white brow. Toots was quiet then for a little while, a very little
      while, for as soon as we decided that his bones were all sound and a
      doctor need not be called, he "played sick," and asked for "shicken brof"
      and toast.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night mamma was imprudent, for she said to a visitor, who was praising
      the little fellow, "Oh, yes, Toots is always lovely and gentle at
      bed-time." That very night while mamma was resting on the lounge, and her
      friend was chatting, both ladies heard a mysterious clicking. "It can't be
      Toots," said mamma; "his eyes were closed when I left him." Then the
      clicking came again louder than ever, and suddenly a crash as of breaking
      glass. Mamma sprang up at once, and there was Toots seated on a bath-tub
      driving for dear life with two of his best sashes for reins. He had
      fastened one on each side of the mirror, and in his eagerness to drive
      fast, had tumbled down toilet-bottles, cushions, and all the pretty things
      his mamma loved to see. Toots was playing circus. Barnum had been in town
      the day before, and Toots had made a grand procession with chairs, books,
      bottles, pictures, and everything his little hands could reach. Such a
      happy, beaming face was never seen before. "Why, Toots, I thought you were
      asleep," said mamma. "No, I hab too much to do, my 'cession is coming up
      street fast."
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was quite small, Toots used to spend hours in the garden safely
      fastened into the standing stool which his grandpa had when a little boy.
      The little fellow's face was so bright, and his large eyes so full of
      innocent fun, that no one could be angry with Toots even when he did very
      strange and unexpected things.

    <h2>
      TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Toots was old
      enough to enter a little school, his mamma said he must go to a
      Kindergarten, which, you all know, is a delightful place for all children.
      Our good German friends first thought of it for their little people, and
      here in America we have found it an excellent fashion to follow. Block
      building, song singing, and drawing with pretty things in needlework, and
      forms in clay, not only teach the children to think but to do, and good
      thinking must always come before well doing, Toots' mamma knew a kind
      German lady who understood teaching the little ones, and after some delay
      a school was opened and Toots was a pupil. He cried hard at first. He was
      afraid of strangers, and he dreaded to speak aloud before them, although
      he was such a rogue at home. His mamma bought him a pretty lunch basket
      and put in it some little cakes for his lunch, and then they rode away in
      the horse car to the schoolroom. After the first day Toots was always
      ready to go. "It is only play," he said. But it was more than play, for
      every night Toots had something new to tell; sometimes he had watered the
      plants in the school-room, sometimes he talked of cubes and triangles,
      sometimes he sang a little song. Toots was learning without knowing it,
      and all the time he was very happy. No one was allowed to say a naughty
      word, no one was ever rude or unkind, and all the little eyes and hands
      were trained.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0007" id="linkimage-0007"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0016.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      When Toots told his grandma about the seed germ of a plant and how it grew
      she said, "Ah, I wish I could have gone to such a school; the children are
      very fortunate now a days." One day Toots brought his grandma a pretty
      book-mark he had worked, and he could tell the names of all the colors in
      it and the names of the stitches. Such pretty things as he made in clay,
      such dainty shapes and forms, it really was quite wonderful to see them
      and hear the little fellow in kilt skirts talk about them. One day Toots
      did not come home from the Kindergarten as usual. His favorite car driver
      shook his head as he passed the house. Toots had not come out to ride home
      with him. Grandma was much worried. "Never mind," said mamma, "he is quite
      safe, perhaps they are all out for walk, or studying the trees or flowers
      in the garden; he will come in the next car, for his teacher always puts
      him on herself." When the next car came, there was the little boy, smiling
      and happy. The children had taken a long walk with their teacher, and when
      they returned Toots had fallen asleep, so the kind teacher would not
      disturb him, and the little fellow was well rested.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner he had a long story to tell about the lungs of plants and the
      edges of leaves, which were like little saws, and a pretty pitcher-plant
      he had seen. When his story was complete he added, "All my children shall
      go to a Kindergarten, for it is the nicest place in the world 'cept
      mamma's room."

      VERY night just before bedtime Toots and his mamma had a happy hour
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes a friend or two would share the pleasures of this evening hour,
      and Toots enjoyed it much more if Bessie or Flossie, or some of his mates,
      could hear mamma's stories or verses written expressly for children. When
      Toots was quite small he was rude enough one day to strike his nurse, and
      after mamma had heard all the story, she read these lines about

      MONG Toots' friends was a little girl whose name was Elfie. She lived just
      across the way, and her papa's garden joined that of Toots' mamma. There
      was a large gate, between the gardens, and the children went back and
      forth in the summer. They seldom quarrelled, and both children were glad
      to share their playthings. When Toots had the scarlet fever and was shut
      up in a room with his mamma and nurse, Elfie cried to have the fever too,
      so she could see him. It was summer time when Toots was sick, and
      sometimes when he was tired and restless he would moan so Elfie could hear
      him in the garden. One day when it was very warm and every one was tired
      and cross, Auntie bathed Elfie and put her on the bed, but she did not
      stay there long; she began to think of Toots&mdash;how warm he must be,
      how tired of the bed and that ugly dark room. Suddenly Elfie remembered
      that people used to bring her mamma pretty flowers when she was ill.
    </p>

    <p>
      Perhaps she might carry Toots some flowers; her auntie was fast asleep and
      the nurse was out. Yes, she would go into the garden and get the prettiest
      flowers there for poor Toots. She had no shoes&mdash;auntie had put them
      away&mdash;and no stockings; but it would not matter; plenty of children
      never had shoes or stockings, and it could not hurt very much, for they
      could run.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then a low moan was heard and that decided Elfie; she sprang up and
      ran down stairs; no one was in sight but Touser, and he was such a good
      dog, he only lapped her bare feet with his tongue, so little Elfie went
      into the garden and began to gather flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she heard another moan from the sick-room, and she ran as fast
      as she could through the gate and up to the door. One of the servants was
      just coming out. "Why, little Elfie!" said she, "you will hurt those poor
      bare feet and you must not come here now, did any one send you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I runned away,'coz I wanted Toots to have some flowers, and I wish I
      could have the fever too, and be sick with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor child!" said the maid, "Master Toots shall have your flowers and he
      is better to-day, only the great heat makes him moan; wait here a bit
      until I send them up to his room and then I will take you home."
    </p>
    <p>
      The flowers were carried to the sick-room and Toots smiled when they told
      him what his little friend said. "Tell her not to wish for the fever," he
      said, "for I feel as if I were on fire, and there is no cool place in the
      bed; but when I am well again we will play together at the fountain and
      keep our store as we used to." Elfie was very happy when she heard this
      message, and after that she sent flowers to the sick boy every day.

      HEN Toots first went to the Kindergarten he met there a little boy whose
      name was Paul Brown. He was a very bright little fellow, but he could not
      talk as well as Toots; some of his words were cut short and it sounded
      very cunning, for Paul did his best and the Kindergarten teacher told the
      boys and girls that no one could do better than his best. One day a little
      baby sister came to Paul's house and this is the story he told his grandpa
      when the old gentleman came in to see the stranger:

      mind about her value. Sometimes, I am sorry to say, he led her into
      mischief, and once they were lost a whole day in the woods because Paul
      wanted to show her how the flowers grew and the trees sang, but after all
      the little girl made him a better boy as we shall see.

      AX was not one of Toots' "really truly friends," so Toots said, but mamma
      and cousin Hattie were kind to Max. He needed friends badly. He had no
      mother, and his father was a cruel, wicked man. One day when Toots and his
      mother were spending the day with cousin Hattie, the latter said, "I have
      some very bad news to tell you. Some wicked boy has torn down my little
      bird-house which papa put in the maple tree for me, and my dear little
      birds have gone away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How cruel!" said Toots.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who could climb over your high wall?" asked his mamma.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot guess," replied cousin Hattie, "but my roses are trampled, and
      papa says it must be a boy, as he measured the footsteps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better watch for the thief, and, perhaps, we can coax him to
      behave better in future." Miss Hattie and the servants watched in vain for
      a week, but one day while the ladies were reading in the library the
      servant knocked to say that a queer-looking boy had just slid down the
      fence, and perhaps he was the thief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies went out at once and found him. He looked ragged and neglected,
      but his face was a good one if it had only been clean and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry you climbed over that way," said cousin Hattie; "whenever you
      would like to see my garden you shall come in if you will ring the bell."
      The boy looked very much ashamed. "Please tell me your name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Max," was the brief reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a very nice name," said cousin Hattie. "Now Max, if you will come
      with me into the kitchen I will find some lunch for you." Max followed her
      in, but he could not eat much; the cook looked at him sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know him, miss," said she, "he is called Max the Meddler. He never lets
      a poor bird or cat have any rest where he is, and he is prying about
      everywhere. I am sure he took your bird-house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cousin Hattie said, "Never mind, cook; he will never do it again; perhaps
      he will earn a new name and a better one." After he had eaten his lunch
      the young lady took him out into the garden and told him the story of her
      birds&mdash;how much she loved them, how her papa put up their house, and
      how sorry she was to have them disturbed. Max looked more than ever
      ashamed. At last he said: "I will never do so again, lady, and if you will
      let me come and work in your garden I will pay you for the little house,
      which I sold to another boy."

      ever knew!
    </p>
    <p>
      She is a tender-hearted child, and, like Toots, very fond of pets. Once on
      a cold winter day she found a poor little dead bird which the snow storm
      of the night before had killed. She brought it to cousin Toots, and
      together they buried it under a snowbank in the garden. One night during
      the "Happy Hour" May said "I wish you wrote some truly verses about me,
      dear auntie," and the very next night auntie did, and here they are:

      HEN Toots was four years old, his mamma thought she would let him have a
      birthday party. She wrote the invitations on the prettiest little paper,
      with funny frogs and dogs and cats in the corner, and each little envelope
      was made to match. Twenty-five pretty little notes to twenty-five dear
      little people, and every one came. No one else ever had such a party
      before. Large tables were covered with books and toys, all manner of games
      were waiting to be played, and in one corner of the children's play-room
      was a table with bowls, plates, and pipes, and all the children were
      invited to blow bubbles. Such fun as they had! Some blew large and some
      blew small, and those who laughed hard blew none at all. At last Toots and
      Robbie Mason began to see something in the soap bubble, "beautiful colors
      like the rainbow," said Toots.
    </p>
    <p>
      "More of them," said Robbie, and then all the children began to wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What makes it?" asked Robbie, eagerly; "I wish I knew?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you," said mamma. "When a ray of light is divided, as it
      always is when it reaches an object on which to rest, it has different
      colors, because each color has different powers and is refracted or turned
      from its course. Let us cast a ray of light on this piece of glass called
      a prism; now examine it closely, here we have seven colors&mdash;red,
      orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet The red is bent out of its
      course the least and it remains at the bottom; the blue is refracted most
      and goes to the top. Now blow a nice bubble, little Daisy, and I will
      explain the colors. You see the film is thicker in some places than in
      others, and that causes different powers of refraction or turning aside of
      the rays, and therefore, you observe different colors; as the soap bubble
      constantly changes its thickness, the rays vary or change also."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There isn't any soap in the real rainbow in the clouds, is there?" asked
      thoughtful Robbie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no; when the clouds opposite the sun are dark and rain is still
      falling, the rays of the bright sun are divided by the rain drops as they
      would be here with my prism." #
    </p>
    <p>
      After the children grew tired of bubbles they had many games and a nice
      supper, after which they went home saying it was the best party they ever
      went to.

      LL Toots' playmates among the boys and girls knew how very fond he was of
      his four-footed friends, and the children were very fond of watching him
      when he made his pets perform all sorts of tricks. Poor Toots was nearly
      ill one day when one of his pet cats was found dead in the stable. He
      cried and would not be comforted, but his mamma said that poor pussy had
      not been well for a long time, and she probably died in a fit. Not long
      after Pussy Meek's death, Toots was confined to his room with a bad cough,
      and his mamma went to a store to buy some cough drops which the doctor had
      ordered. When the old lady who kept the store heard that Toots was ill she
      said, "I wish I had something nice to send him; he is so polite and kind.
      Do you suppose he would like another kitten? We have three beauties now,
      and our cat mother is a fine old mouser."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He would like it very much. I left him just now crying for his dear pet
      Pussy Meek."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear little fellow!" said the old lady, "he shall have the very prettiest
      one we have."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she took a candy-box and made some holes in it and put the prettiest
      little kitty inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toots was wild with pleasure; he sat up in bed and held her in his arms,
      then he fed her some warm milk, and at last she cuddled down with her
      little head peeping out of the bosom of his night-gown, and then she slept
      a long, long time. Toots was much troubled to find a pretty name for her.
      At last he said, "poor little Pussy, we cannot find a name good enough or
      sweet enough for you." His mamma said suppose we call her <i>Psyche.</i>
      This pleased Toots very much and the new kitty was duly named Pysche, and
      a nice ribbon was tied about her neck. For many days she lived in Toots'
      room and nestled close to him. As she grew older she grew wiser and very
      full of fun. All summer long she chased flies and grasshoppers, and when
      the children played ball, Pysche understood it all and took her place
      properly. She has two very cunning tricks&mdash;one was to never enter a
      door if she could make some one open a window to let her in, and the other
      was to hide away at bedtime and then come out to play when all the house
      was still. In the summer time Pysche went to the seaside with the family,
      where she was a great pet with the grown-up people as well as the
      children.

      LOSSIE helps ever so much," said Toots, one day&mdash;"she dusts the
      chairs in her mother's room, waters the plants, and holds her auntie's
      worsted. Her auntie is knitting a new rug for the phaeton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Little hands should always help," said mamma, "they were made to be
      useful, and I know Flossie is happier when she is doing something to make
      home pleasant. One day I heard Flossie saying, "Oh dear! I wish I had
      something to do. I am tired of my dollies, I don't want to read, and there
      is no one here for me to play with." I said, "My dear little girl, your
      mamma has too much to do; she will give you something, and auntie will be
      glad to have you help her; those little hands must be kept busy every
      day." Soon after Flossie learned how to dust the chairs, then she picked
      the bits of thread from the carpet, then she gave the canary some food and
      water, and now she is making a dress for her dollie. In a few short months
      Flossie will learn to do a great many useful things and no one will hear
      her say, "I wish I had something to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I always have enough to do," said Toots, "I cannot get time to read half
      the books I like, and then there are so many pets to take care of, beside
      the skating and sliding in winter, and the fun at the seaside in summer,
      and when I am at grandpa's he calls me 'a little worker.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Flossie came running after Toots. "Would he go with her to buy
      some rolls for tea and take a book back to the library?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Toots was very glad to go and carry some books for mamma, beside he must
      stop at the post-office for some stamps, and bring home a sheet of
      transparent paper to make some paper balloons for the children in the
      hospital. Such busy little people as they were! and how happy, too!
    </p>
    <p>
      That night when Toots was fast asleep, his good mother said to his papa:
      "Children do more than we give them credit for; last week I kept an
      account of all the kind and useful things performed by our little boy, and
      it would surprise you to see how much it all amounts to. Beside the
      errands for me he has thought of others, and that is good for us all. I
      really think he has found more pleasure in mending old books and toys for
      sick children than in having them for himself, and Flossie is quite
      another little girl since she learned to help mamma."

      Jamie had once been a very active boy and a good scholar, but his back was
      injured by a blow given him by a thoughtless playmate, and ever since he
      has been a great sufferer. It is a dreadful thing to injure any one for
      life, and boys cannot be too careful when playing with each other. I am
      sorry to say that the little boy who hurt Jamie does not seem to care for
      the terrible ruin he has wrought; perhaps he has not been taught at home
      to think kindly and tenderly of others.

      OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.

    </div>
    <p>
      LIVER TWIST was the name of a fine rooster or gamecock which belonged to
      Toots' grandpa, and many were the stories told of him. He became quite
      famous in the family, and out of it, and none of the children wanted him
      killed or sold even if he grew too old to walk. When grandpa bought Oliver
      he carried him home between his knees in the carriage, while he drove
      Frisk, the pony. Toots' mamma sat by his side with a huge basket in her
      lap containing a fine old mother hen with ten little chicks. They were all
      going into grandpa's coop at the farm, and then he would take care of them
      for Toots.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose I have been very foolish to pay such a price for this fellow,"
      said grandpa, "but he is smart enough to peck pretty hard."
    </p>
    <p>
      All the way to the farm the new rooster made himself as disagreeable as he
      could, now biting grandpa's hands, and now his knees, until the dear old
      man wished he had never seen him. At last he was safe in the hen-house,
      where he soon began to eat, and, as he never seemed satisfied, he was
      called Oliver Twist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There has been an old fox about here stealing chicks," said the hired
      man, "but this Oliver will tackle him, I reckon."
    </p>
    <p>
      The hired man was right. Only a few days after grandpa heard a great noise
      among the poultry, and there was a large fox trying to get into the
      chicken-yard from the barn. Grandpa stole softly into the house and got
      his gun. When he went back Oliver was pecking at the head and eyes of the
      fox with all his might. Oliver was very angry but did not show any signs
      of fear, while the fox tried in vain to get nearer. At last the old fox
      made up his mind to spring over and eat chicken for his lunch, but just
      then, bang! went grandpa's gun, and the sly enemy tumbled over on the barn
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Oliver heard the gun he thought he was shot too, for he fell down and
      closed his eyes. When grandpa petted and praised him, and held out a dish
      of corn, he seemed to think better of it, and began to strut about, while
      all the hens cackled in chorus and seemed very proud of their defender.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Oliver met with an accident during the cold winter weather; his
      beautiful red comb was frozen and fell off. He seemed so ashamed of it
      that he could not or would not hold up his head, but a nice new comb has
      grown now and he is as proud and lordly as ever. Indeed, only yesterday he
      was seen driving a strange cat out of the yard.

      P at grandpa's farm the chicks were very happy since the old fox was
      killed, and as Toots wanted some more cunning little ones to play with and
      feed when he went up for a visit, grandpa decided to put some eggs under
      Mrs. White. Now, Mrs. White was a very fine hen, and although she had
      never raised any chicks of her own, she seemed so kind and gentle that
      grandpa was sure she would make a kind mother. He selected the eggs with
      great care, marking some very choice ones with a blue pencil. Mrs. White
      sat very quietly upon her nest for many days, until it was time for the
      little chicks to come out of their shell houses; then grandpa paid her a
      visit. Three little ones were already toddling about, and Mrs. White
      seemed to be in great distress concerning some others who were just trying
      to see what the world was made of. Grandpa helped the little fellows by
      picking away small bits of the shell, and then he hurried away to make
      some nice dough for them. When he returned, Mrs. White was nowhere to be
      seen, so grandpa covered the little new babies with some wool and then
      looked for the neglectful mother. He soon found her in the yard with
      Oliver Twist and a large flock of hens.

      Grandpa caught her and carried her back, but Mrs. White hurt the little
      ones and refused to scratch for them. She covered them with her wings for
      a few moments while grandpa was there, and then ran away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandpa tried shutting her up, but still she hurt her little chicks and at
      last killed one. Then grandpa told her she was a cruel, wicked mother, and
      he carried the chicks into the kitchen and covered them over in a nice
      warm basket. There they nestled for several days until they began to hop
      out and get under grandma's feet. After that they had a little house in
      the shed and soon grew very fast. Toots called them the orphans, and never
      again liked Mrs. White, although she was so handsome. Soon after this
      grandpa put some eggs under a queer old hen which all the family called
      Mrs. Gummidge, she was so cross and queer. When her chicks came she was a
      very kind mother and scratched for them all day long. She was very proud
      of them, too, and seemed to say, "Did you ever see such little darlings?"
      Mrs. Gummidge went about with her children until they were large enough to
      take care of themselves, and then she sat quietly on some more eggs and
      raised another family, but none of them ever seemed quite so precious to
      Toots as the little neglected chicks of Mrs. White.

      WO dear little girlies, born at the same time, with eyes, hair, and little
      faces so exactly alike that even their mother could not tell them apart;
      and when their pictures were taken and sent to Toots' papa, every one
      wondered which was Bud and which was Bunnie. The twins' papa was an old
      classmate of Toots' papa, and as soon as the baby girls came he wrote a
      very funny letter telling all about them. He said they were both like
      little rosebuds, and he was puzzled to know what to call them, so he
      simply nicknamed them Bud and Bunnie until the mamma could decide upon a
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are dear little bits of womanhood," he said, when the children were
      three years old, "and I am ashamed to say that we still go on calling them
      by the old pet names. It would please you to see them at play, they are so
      very happy. Bunnie, who is a little more gentle than her sister, often
      gives up to her in their sports; and yet Bud is never cross. She takes the
      lead because she is fitted for it, while Bunnie nestles down and is
      content to do as she is told. They are into mischief every hour in the day&mdash;good-natured
      mischief of course. Sometimes we find them dressed in their mother's
      clothes, sometimes in my coats.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not long ago my wife and I determined to send a hamper of good things to
      her old nurse, who has been very unfortunate. We collected all our gifts
      and were about to pack them, when we chanced to think of a new prayer-book
      in large type, so away we went, to buy it, for she would not go without me
      and I would not know how to select without her. When we returned to the
      store-room where we were packing, what did we see but our twins, Bud and
      Bunnie, both seated in the hamper. They made such a charming picture that
      I sketched them on the spot."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Toots' papa sent back a letter at once, and said they were the
      dearest little girlies in the world, and he wished he had some himself;
      but he was quite sure that his boys were just as good boys as ever grew,
      and he would send their pictures to prove it.

      A dearer girl than our Daisy Dean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy was much pleased with her little verses, "all her own," as she said,
      and I heard her whispering to her friend May that she would never sulk
      again if she could help it. Daisy has one serious fault: she never puts
      things in their places. One morning she could not find her hat anywhere,
      and her mamma made her go to school without it. Daisy cried and wanted to
      wear her best one, but her mamma said, "No; that would not teach her to
      remember." The girls were much amused when Daisy entered the dressing-room
      at school without any hat on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you done with it?" asked May.

      "I don't know; it is lost somewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a careless little girl! Why, I always hang mine up in one place when
      I go home from school or play," said May.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So do I," said several of the girls, but some of the boys did not speak,
      and a little bird whispers to me that some of my kindest "little friends
      throw their caps down on the floor, table, lounge, chairs, or the first
      place they can find." Oh, oh, boys! this is too bad, for "order is
      heaven's first law."

      THE COMMISSARY.

    <p>
      COMMISSARY is one who furnishes supplies of food to an army or body of
      men, but I dare say you never heard of a dog commissary. He lived at the
      boarding-school where Toots' mamma went when a little girl, and his owner
      was the lady who kept the school. Her son brought him home one day and
      taught him many tricks. Every day he went to market for the family, and it
      was great fun for the younger girls to see "Captain Com" go out with his
      basket in his mouth. His errands were always faithfully done. No boy ever
      dared to meddle with Com, and although he went five blocks to market no
      one ever tried to get his note out of the basket. Every morning he waited
      until madam consulted with cook and wrote down the order, and then when it
      was put into his care he would trot away in a very happy frame of mind.
      "Com" was very good to the younger pupils. He would let them drive him in
      a little cart, or play tag with them by the hour. Once in the vacation,
      when nearly all the pupils had gone home, madam said: "We will not send an
      order to the butcher to-day; it is so warm, we will have a light lunch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Com" did not like this; he was very restless for a long time, and at last
      one of the children said, "I think Com has gone to market. He tried to get
      his basket from the nail and he could not; then he ran away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will go out for a walk and see," said madam, "for 'Com' can do
      everything but talk, and he is greatly distressed because I did not order
      dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the butcher's, there was "Com" with his paws on the
      cutting block, patiently waiting to be served.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He deserves a nice dinner," said the butcher, and he gave him some meat;
      still "Com" was not satisfied; he wanted it put up in paper and laid in a
      basket before he would go away. "Com" never would touch a bit of meat
      until he went home to cook, with his marketing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where Com lived they did not have letter carriers or postmen, and his
      mistress made a little mail-bag for him which he carried to the office
      morning and night. He always entered by the back door, and the clerk would
      kindly wait upon him. Sometimes his bag would be full of letters and
      papers for the pupils, and then "Com" was very proud. Every night this
      wise dog guarded the house, and madam always felt quite happy about the
      younger children if "Com" was with them.

      O wise person ever expects children to be perfect&mdash;grown people are
      not&mdash;still all can try to overcome their faults and grow wiser day by
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although little May was a very sweet child, as she grew older she began to
      fret about little things, and one day when she was urged to learn her
      lesson in arithmetic she said, "I wish I never had to see another old
      arithmetic; I hate them all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      May's mother was very patient, and she had her own thoughts about
      punishing children. When her little daughter showed such ill-temper she
      said, quietly: "May dear, I am going out to do some errands; would you
      like to go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      May was delighted; she would do any thing to get away from her hateful
      book. Their first visit was to a shop where fruit was sold, and then to a
      florist's where the lady bought some flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now where shall we go, mamma?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will see presently, my dear. We will take a car and make a call on a
      friend of mine."
    </p>

    <p>
      At last they got out and went up some steps, where a lad answered their
      ring at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they entered they saw a little girl seated on a chair with her hands
      folded. She was blind. She heard their footsteps and said, "Please be
      seated, ladies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long have you been blind, dear?" asked May's mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Four years, madam. I was very ill and have never seen the light since."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must remember many things which you saw before your illness?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes; and it makes me very happy. I know just how the grass looks, and
      how blue the sky is, and when I am tired I think of it over and over."
    </p>
    <p>
      After some more conversation the matron came in and gladly welcomed May
      and her mother. "I would like to show my little girl through the school,"
      said the latter, and the matron kindly took them into various rooms. Not
      one of the children could see, yet all seemed happy and busy. Some were
      getting lessons, some were knitting, the boys in the work-room were
      putting new seats into chairs, and yet all were blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sad sight to little May, and after she had left the flowers and
      fruit she went away looking quite thoughtful: Since that day she never
      complains when asked to get a lesson, and even her music is not tiresome
      when she thinks of blind Maggie.

    <p>
      NE day in the summer Toots sat on the doorstep talking with his little
      friend, Fred Haldon, when a man came up to the gate with a hand-organ and
      asked if he might come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mamma! mamma!" called Toots, "come as soon as you can, for he has a
      monkey with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother looked out of the window and nodded to the man. "Yes, he could
      play if he wished." Then she went out on the doorstep with the children.
      The monkey came to her at once. It looked so tired and sad, she said,
      "Poor little fellow!" He seemed to understand her, for he sprang into her
      lap and rubbed his head against her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How tired he is!" she said kindly, "do let him rest while we feed him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The monkey would not eat much, he seemed too weary, but he bowed his
      thanks and then put his head on her hand again. When the man stopped
      playing the lady told him he would lose his monkey if he did not let it
      rest.

    <p>
      The man laughed and sat down under a tree. This seemed to please the
      monkey, for he went to him and kissed him and then returned to his new
      friend, nestling down in her lap like a tired child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has danced too much when it was warm," said the man in broken English.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you must be very good and let him sleep." After a good rest the
      organ-grinder went away with him, and soon after Toots went with all the
      family to the sea-side, where the monkeys in the park made them think of
      their tired little visitor. Long, long after, when winter came and all the
      family were in town and all the aunts and cousins were invited to meet
      grandpa Bergland&mdash;little May's grandpa from over the sea, the door
      opened just in the very midst of the Christmas festival, and in walked
      Leno, all dressed in his best suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is his master?" asked Toots, "bring him in and let him show us the
      old tricks."
    </p>
    <p>
      So the master came in. He said, "the kind ladies and gentlemen must excuse
      him, but he could not make Leno pass the gate where the lady was so kind
      to him when he was sick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was quite sick then, poor thing!" said Toots' mamma.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was very sick, dear lady. I took him away in the cool country, but he
      was like to die, and for many days I thought I must leave him there, for
      he could neither eat nor sleep, only look in my face and make a sad noise.
      I could not Leno die, for he is my only friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, mamma," said grandpa Bergland, "you was kind to the dumb brute and
      it did thank you."

    <p>
      MAN who took charge of the park was very kind to Toots and allowed him to
      feed the parrots, birds, and rabbits. The rabbit-house was a favorite
      place with the children. They never tired of watching them, and the family
      was so large that the good keeper who cared for them called the old rabbit
      "Mr. Smith."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see he has so many children, his name must be Smith," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children fed them grass and clover, and many of the little creatures
      had pet names, but it was impossible to name them all, for the family
      increased so fast. One morning when the gardener went into the park to
      look at some plants he had set out the day before, he found them all out
      of the ground and the earth thrown about in every direction. "Ah!" said
      he, "those puppies must be shut up; they did all this mischief last night;
      I heard them barking."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the gardener took the three puppies and shut them in a cellar, while
      he hurried his garden-making, in order to get more plants in place before
      the superintendent came that way. He was so anxious to get the plants
      cared for before the sun was hot that he quite neglected the other pets.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was hard at work Toots ran to him crying, "Oh, Mr. Snyder, they
      are all out, the whole of Mr. Smith's family, and there is a big hole dug
      down under their house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough, the house was empty and the family nowhere to be seen. Toots
      and the boys found them at last hiding under some steps. After some
      trouble and much chasing about over the grounds they were put into their
      cage and the big hole was securely fastened.
    </p>

      Toots released the puppies and fed them well, while Mr. Smith's family
      seemed tired out with their travels and were glad to lie down and rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening while the family sat on the piazza watching the moonlight on
      the water, something ran up the steps and hid in one corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be one of those ugly rats," said Aunt Bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed, it is some poor hunted thing seeking refuge," said mamma.
      "Bring me a lamp, Bridget, and let us see."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lamp was brought and there in one corner of the piazza was a poor,
      lonely little rabbit. He had strayed from the rest, and now when it was
      dark he sought shelter where he heard familiar voices.

    <p>
      T was a queer, very queer name, but the soldiers gave it to him, and when
      you hear how he conducted himself you will not wonder. Daddy Tough lived
      in a fort in the western country, and he belonged to the United States
      Government. On one side he had the letters "U. S." branded, in order to
      keep people from stealing him. The children in the fort all called those
      letters "Uncle Sam," and everything with that mark on it was said to
      belong to Uncle Sam, meaning the Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children about the fort used to ride on his back in a sort of double
      saddle made of willow. One day the soldiers took him inside of a small
      gate in order to remove some ashes from a cellar. The cart was backed in
      and Daddy stood with his head just outside of the gate. He looked like a
      droll picture in a frame. There he stood winking his eyes and shaking his
      long ears. When the soldiers had the ashes all in the wagon they told
      Daddy to go on, but he would not move; then they coaxed him but he did not
      stir. His driver pelted and pulled, but Daddy winked and never moved a
      step.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must get him away somehow," said the soldiers, and at last they struck
      him. Daddy looked at them in the most reproachful manner, but he did not
      move an inch. For more than half an hour the poor soldiers tried to have
      him carry his burden away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must be all cleared up before dress parade," said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must get him out of here somehow," said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just think how the boys would laugh if they saw Daddy standing here
      winking while the colonel was issuing his orders at dress parade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will never do," said the driver. "Come, Daddy, you must move on or you
      will disgrace the command."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daddy looked knowing, but still stood firm. Other soldiers came and they
      tried, but Daddy would not yield even after hard whipping. Then the
      colonel came out and told them what to do, but Daddy winked at the colonel
      as if to say, "I like this place very much and I will not go even for
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      When all efforts had failed the colonel's wife said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me try; we cure horses of ill-temper by feeding them sugar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing will cure Daddy," said her husband, "but you may try."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady brought out some sugar and gave Daddy a taste. He shook his ears
      and made a sort of grunt. Then she patted him and held it farther away and
      at last he marched after her out of the gate and ran so fast he upset part
      of the ashes. After that when Daddy grew sulky a little sugar would win
      him over.

      OOTS had a brother much older than himself, and never were two boys better
      friends. Nothing pleased Toots more than stories of his brother's pranks
      when he was small. Then Toots' parents travelled nearly all the time, and
      their eldest boy saw a great deal of this busy world. All the soldiers in
      his father's regiment called him "Button Blue," for when they first saw
      him he wore little dresses with a good many buttons on them. After that he
      had a jacket and pants, or, as he called them, "Bocker-nickers." He was a
      droll little fellow, and always managed to twist words about. The soldiers
      were very fond of Button, and made him many presents. They taught him
      games of all kinds, and here we see him showing the major's little
      daughter how to play cat's cradle.

      One day Button Blue was lost and all the camp was astir. The black man,
      whose duty it was to care for him, said he left him at the sutler's little
      store, and the sutler said he saw him playing with a dog near the
      flag-staff just before the general's door. The general was away on
      horseback and he had not taken the child, for some one had seen seen him
      riding away with one of his officers and their orderlies. The men were
      nearly wild over the lost boy, but Button's mother said she only feared
      his going to the river, and yet Button never went anywhere without
      permission. The dinner hour came and went, but no boy answered to the
      summons, and men were sent in different directions to find him. They had
      not returned when the general came up on horseback.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are in great trouble, sir," said the surgeon; "the colonel's boy is
      lost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Button, our little Button; it is impossible. Have you sent out men to
      search? Have you looked in all the men's quarters? Why, bless you, I
      kissed the little rogue good-bye the last thing before starting; we had a
      grand romp together. I will go myself to search for him." The general
      sprang off his horse and unlocked the door of the little house known as
      his headquarters. He threw his gloves on the table and said aloud in an
      anxious tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I love that rascal like one of my own. He must be somewhere about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have searched everywhere, sir, and no trace can be found. Even the
      colonel is discouraged, but his mother will not give up. She says he will
      be found."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Found! found! of course he will," replied the general. "Why, there isn't
      a man or boy that doesn't love Button."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here I am, General," piped a boy's voice; and there, just waking up from
      a sound sleep, was the boy who had slipped in as the general's servant
      locked the door, and then, tired with play, threw himself on a lounge
      behind a screen where his friend the general had often rested.

      T was a dreary, rainy day, and Toots and his cousins were gathered in the
      library, where a cheerful open fire made them forget the chilling rain
      outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Auntie," said May, "please tell me why you keep that pretty bird always
      sitting above your desk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Toots has something to do with that. It is his bird, and perhaps you
      would like to hear about it; wait one moment until I get you a dish of
      fruit, and I will tell you how the pretty bird came here:
    </p>
    <p>
      "One summer when Toots was quite small and not very strong, our family
      doctor said, 'Couldn't you go and camp out in the pine woods somewhere for
      a few weeks?' At first it seemed quite impossible to take all the family,
      but Button Blue was so active and helpful, and the cook said she would
      like the fun of it, so at last we went, taking care to be near a house
      where we could get pure water. We had two tents. One was our parlor by day
      and the boys' bedroom by night; the other held my bed and an easy camp cot
      for Toots. We were very cosey and happy. The birds sang over our heads all
      day, and at night we could hear the whip-poor-will's note only a few feet
      from our tent door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you do when it rained?" asked one of the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We drew the tent curtains close, made little ditches outside to carry off
      the water, and read, played games, or told stories. One day a party of
      gentlemen came to our camp. They were out hunting, and one of them had in
      his game bag a pretty cuckoo he had just killed. Poor Toots felt terribly
      when he saw it. Only the day before he had heard its pretty note, 'Cuckoo!
      cuckoo!' and we had told him that its name was given it because it made
      that peculiar song."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think he was wicked to shoot it," said Toots.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We all felt very sorry," said his mother, "and I think the hunters did,
      too, for they promised to keep away from our camp and avoid shooting any
      of our pets. When they left us, they told Toots he would hear from them
      again, but we forgot all about it until one day a small box was brought to
      our house by the expressman. It was directed to Toots and marked 'with
      care.' On opening it we found our little friend the cuckoo handsomely
      stuffed and mounted on a branch. Toots was very much pleased and it has
      stood where it now is ever since it came."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish he could fly once more, and say 'Cuckoo, cuckoo,' as he used to,"
      said Toots.

    <p>
      KIND lady and dear friend of Toots and his mother owns a bright little dog
      named Benjamina. Its mother was blind and lame when the little puppy was
      born, and the good lady thought it was the child of the dog mother's old
      age; so she called it Benjamina, and a very cunning, wise little creature
      she is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjamina likes to curl up on a sofa pillow and take life easy. Nearly
      every day she takes a walk with her mistress and frisks about here and
      there. Once when they were out walking, naughty Bennie ran too near the
      horse car and was kicked by one of the horses. She lay quite still for a
      moment, and all who saw her feared she was dead. Before any one could
      reach her, a large, strong dog who belonged to a neighbor sprang across
      the street and carried her to her mistress. Poor doggie had a bad cut in
      her side which the doctor sewed up, and it was so very sore that she could
      not lie down for many days. It was quite pitiful to see it walk around and
      around in a circle, trying to go to sleep. Old Major came every day to see
      her, and when he was allowed to come into the room he would sit down
      gravely and look at her. He evidently wanted to say, "I am very, very
      sorry for you and shall be glad to see you out again."

      After a time poor Benjamina grew well enough to sit in a chair at the
      window, and Major would sit outside on the piazza and look at her. They
      really seemed to understand each other perfectly. If anything went wrong
      in the street Major would run down the steps and attend to it, and then
      come back to his station before the window. At last Bennie was taken out
      for a drive and Major ran all the way by the side of the carriage, barking
      with pleasure.
    </p>

      Once Bennie's mistress found a large bone put on her piazza, which Major
      had brought for his friend's breakfast, and great was the good fellow's
      delight when it was carried to Bennie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major went to church every Sunday and sat in the porch until his master
      came out; he tried very hard to go inside but was never allowed to do so.
      When the sexton went out to open the doors Major would shake himself and
      take his position on the steps. Once he came on Sunday and tried to coax
      Bennie out, but her mistress said no. When I last saw Bennie she was
      sitting in her mistress' lap while she wrote some letters. Major is still
      the same faithful friend and visits her every day.

      OW happy the little people were at the seashore! There was so much to see
      and so much to do that the long days ran quickly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toots and his friend learned many things. They caught hermit crabs, and
      were told how they stole shell houses to live in. They found star fish,
      and horse-shoe crabs, and beautiful sea anemones, and sometimes a kind old
      sailor would tell them about trawls, lobster traps, nets, and the queer
      tricks of the various fish they caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away out on a point of rocks near the water lived some very bright little
      boys who often came to play with Toots. One day their parents were invited
      to visit a beautiful yacht lying in the harbor. The ladies and gentlemen
      were much pleased, and when they returned from their visit they told the
      children all about it. Two little boys, Philip and Harry, who lived in the
      cottage at the point, heard the story with much pleasure; so did Toots,
      who wished he could see it. One morning when the wind blew hard and the
      water was covered with white caps, Philip's mother missed both her little
      boys. "Perhaps they have gone over to Toots'," she said. Their sister
      inquired, but Toots was swinging in the hammock with another little
      friend. He had not seen Philip or Harry all the morning. Then the nurse
      and all the family began to look, but no boys could they find.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last an old sailor said, "There's a little boat a-bob-bing up and down
      out there, and I think it has two little chaps in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies took a glass, and there indeed were the two little rogues
      liable to be drowned at any moment; but two kind sailors went after them
      and brought them safe on shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where were you going?" asked their mamma.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To visit the Tommodore's pretty water-house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Both boys were very small and could not speak distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how strange! you were not invited," said their mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, I 'vited 'Ilip and 'Ilip Vited me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you have done if you had reached the yacht?"'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was going to 'duce 'Ilip to the Tommodore and 'Ilip was going to 'duce
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you must not introduce people anywhere unless you are welcome
      yourself and invited. When the Commodore invites my little boys, I will
      take them out to his yacht and introduce them myself. Besides, the water
      is very rough and you are too young to row a boat so far."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We could do it;'cause 'Ilip rowed one oar and I rowed the other. We like
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Their mother was very glad to get them back again, and the good Commodore
      never knew what funny little guests he missed seeing that summer morning.

      "I think," said Toots, "that every song you read is the best one, and I
      wish birds could talk.

      "They certainly talk to each other," said his mother, "and the robins in
